            <h2>The Journey of a Second-Year Student</h2>

                I’m a second-year student, navigating life with the guidance of my two older brothers and the sacrifices of our parents, 
                who are both overseas Filipino workers (OFWs). My eldest brother is my protector and guide, always there to support me. 
                The middle sibling and I don’t get along as well, but he’s still a part of the family dynamic that shapes me. 
                Growing up in this environment has made me who I am today—resilient, independent, and determined to succeed.

                Life changed dramatically when I was just 8 years old. My dad had to leave for Singapore to earn a living for our family. 
                This was a difficult adjustment for all of us, but it was a necessary step to secure a better future. Then, when I turned 12, my mom also 
                left to work abroad, moving to Dubai. Their sacrifices taught me the importance of hard work and resilience. Without them around, I had to grow up quickly. 
                I learned to take care of myself by cooking, cleaning, and even doing my own laundry. These early lessons in independence have stayed with me, 
                and I’m grateful for the strong foundation they’ve given me.

                During this time, my grandmother, whom I lovingly call "Mamadha," stepped in to fill the void left by my parents. 
                She became my guardian and protector, teaching me valuable life skills and sharing stories that helped me understand the sacrifices my parents were making. 
                Mamadha’s wisdom and love were a source of comfort during those challenging years. Her unwavering support gave me the strength to persevere, 
                even when I missed my parents terribly.

                My journey as a student hasn’t always been smooth. In my first year, I was filled with anxiety. Someone had told me that college life would be difficult 
                without friends, and that thought weighed heavily on me. However, things began to change when I met Kuya Michael, who sat beside me at the back of the class. 
                On the very first day, he started yapping non-stop, which led to me getting scolded by the professor! Despite the rocky start, Kuya Michael became one of my closest friends. 
                He introduced me to a wonderful group of people who have since become my second family—Justin, Aaron, Mikko, James, Sean Ivan, and Kuya Ricardo.

                My life took a beautiful turn when I met Mary Bernadette Abuan, my girlfriend. Mary is the most beautiful, smart, kind, and loving person I know. 
                She has been my greatest motivator and my anchor. Mary taught me to focus on my academics and prioritize my goals. With her unwavering support, 
                I managed to pass my first semester, something I once thought was impossible. She’s been my constant cheerleader, reminding me of my potential and pushing me to be my best self.

                Despite the challenges of having parents abroad, I remain motivated by their sacrifices. 
                They’ve worked tirelessly to give us a better life and a brighter future. Their story inspires me to persevere and achieve my dreams so I can give back to them one day. 
                Every challenge I face reminds me of their hard work and dedication. I strive to make them proud by excelling in my studies and becoming a person they can be proud of.
